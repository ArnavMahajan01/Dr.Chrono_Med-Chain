In this project, we created a website which allows hospitals and pharmacies to see from where they can import various medicinal supplies and at what price. The website has been made using HTML, CSS, Javascript with PHP handling the server side code. We have also integrated a chatbot which can predict the disease if symptoms are given. The chatbot has been hosted on Heroku and need not be run on the local server. The website has also been hosted.

The chatbot was made using Python and uses the flask web framework for receiving requests.
